# Job Scraping

The idea of web scraping always seemed like a really interesting concept, so after reading some documentation and googling a few things here and there, I built a simple Python program that compiles the job postings from several companies that I'm interested in and outputs the information in an Excel file. Data are extracted from websites primarily through BeautifulSoup.
